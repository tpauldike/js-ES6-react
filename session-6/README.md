# Session 6; Day 14
This was how far we journeyed together in exactly two weeks 
of learning `JavaScript` with `React.js` in view, and conforming 
as much as possible, to the **ES6** standard.

In this session, we learned about the following:
- Function default parameters
- Template literals
- Destructuring
- `map()`, `filter()`, `find()` and `reduce()`

At this point, we had as well built from very simple to a bit
complex things with `JavaScript`, especially manipulating `HTML`
and `CSS` documents.

The video for this session will be available on *21st May, 2023* on
YouTube.
